**LOGIC PROOF CHECKER**

Web application that validates proofs that students submit for Intro to Logic courses taught at universities. Our system saves professors and teaching assistants hours since they no longer have to tediously, manually grade a large number of logic proof submissions. 

It’s been used by over a dozen students at CSU Monterey Bay this past semester, and will be officially used by over 70 students in Fall ’19 @ CSUMB.
